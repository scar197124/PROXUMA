# Proxuma

**Status: COMPLETE**

Proxuma is an offline-first system designed to help people understand what links are really doing — without tracking, fear, or cloud scanning.

---

## Why Proxuma Exists

Too many people are forced to choose between *blind trust* and *overwhelming security tools*.

Proxuma was built to sit calmly in between.

It does **not** block links.  
It does **not** redirect traffic.  
It does **not** profile users or send data to the cloud.

Instead, Proxuma explains — in plain language — what a link or QR code is *actually doing*, so people can make their own decision before clicking.

## Components

- **Proxuma Hub** (this repository) — system definition & coordination  
- **Proxuma Lite** — fast, no-redirect link & QR checks *(frozen)*  
- **Proxuma Shield** — advanced, bounded analysis *(v1 defined)*  
- **Proxuma Sense** — educational and visual explanations  

Lite is frozen.  
Lab v1 is closed.  
Shield v1 is defined and bounded.

This repository represents a **completed, public‑ready state**.
